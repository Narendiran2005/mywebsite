<div><h4>13th April 2022,</h4><p>Till yesterday (12.04.2022 Tuesday) talked with her.. but not in class as usual i don't know whyyyy


On Monday (11-04-2022) she didn't speak. Don't know why. Can be due to my friend mano catching me to go with her  or so anything


I didn't sleep that day.. I called mano at 10 and scorlded him for catching me. all because of mano

I started to fear slighty.  . But all not gone to problem as she talk with me yesterday..

But not talked with her today..


      Life continues........

<br>
<h4>22 April 2022,</h4>
  Today 22 April , yesterday 21 April 2022(Thursday) i mwt with same incident . On Wednesday 20 April the same nightmare of not talking.. I just feared that we fully bullyed her. Mano was the important case in that. Along with others like sree Hari and lohit Raj.. 
                                                   Jai hind.....   You need to be yourself unless you cannot be an airline pilot

<div><h4>10th May 2022,</h4><p>Today 10th May 2022 (Tuesday) , Today I took the decision about how i was before(in old school) and now.. I was so happy with my old school life with full of friends.( Also here I got my best friends like motta , Deena ,mano and others including sheyas Loki Rahul siddhu and parasu Gautam ). But my old school with full of only boys. I remembered my old days with Vishnu rithick Loki sabari......    Full of funs. I think this school was bit unfamiliar for me especially with girls they come to talk but I fly from there .. since I never talk to any girls in my life time.. i talked with a girl for first time in this school. Missing my old staff Kamal sir, ramapraba mam and bakiyaraj sir they supported me in my hard time .. So it's always time to follow my old school tradition and respect it. Still a AKT ian 
   AI will never change..      

                        Jai hind.....     You need to be yourself unless you cannot be an airline pilot.      Pilots never walk they love flying</p></div>






<div><h4>11 May 2022</h4><p>May 11, 2022 (Wednesday)  ,,  As every day just suffering from happiness in my life. Many nice things happened but not lasted so time. But the day went. I don't know why but I feel lonely even when surrounded by mano kiruba shreyas. Completed today permutations and combinations chaptest scored 91.. copied but not all atmost only 3 or 4 questions but even during the exam my mind can't concentrate on it 

Just daily thinking of same thing does not doany help in tackling my sorrow but increases it.

I know everything i think was due to my assumption that overthinking will make me happy but it slowly kills 

I want to say sorry to motta he feels the same but I shouted and make fun of him

He cursed me saying you will one day feel the same..

I feeling it now. 

Don't know what to do. Only companion in this world other than best friends and parent is my tab mobile and computer. And this diary..

Can't stop thinking and overthink  

All credit goes to my old school 😂😂😂.(but crying inside).  But the best school for me is AKT, where everyone will be themselves and not other they don't fond of girls but they won't give them up if they had problems. Even we won't talk to them..  

          Happened in my old school before 2 weeks. Jagadeesan (math teacher of class 11 and 12) spoke some filty words to a girl and the girl informed this matter to our 12th boys and the boys (Naveen, nikhi,......l) beat the teacher and broke his head in the bathroom 👌👌👌👌👌😎😎. And the 11 th boys surrounded the area. And the teacher was suspended and the school didn't take action on students. This is what real school and bond. Not in this which they simply but fake</p></div>








 <div><h4>15th May 2022,</h4><p>. Today 12 classes started. Met the school vibe. Crowd bathroom and alleyways.. and myself getting cured from my own problems and now I am most ready and I got my old concentration in class and study time. But now not crying but feeling sad for being sad these many days and wasted my time even my holidays and free time,, family time. 
Motta came yesterday at 4pm. As I thought he stated to make fun of me. All due to one man MANO🥲🥲🥲🥲🥲. But he shared memes on Motta and Deena which was full of worth. And Motta told that all hostel boys should not talk to girls. As he was hurt. I feel sorry for Motta whatever I made fun of him . I know how much difficult is that the phase he crossed and what he experienced. I asked sorry to him. 
    At night 9:30pm we was listening song on speaker outside with all my friends including bro's and chit chated for 20min.. almost after muchdays we spoke . Motta atlast spoke to allu. It's all good. Just for another 1 month they stay here. Feeling sad hearing this but can't avoid it as it is truth.😔😔😔. Today asusal School class we mano parasu kiruba all was chating. And we had today assembly. It last long but not like pervious one. 1 period English gone asusal as we don't listen English. I mano and kiruba was making comments on lesson. 2nd chemistry we had our pratical season today. Mam asked us to write record note. But we lazzy fellows insted we took photo. I and kiruba got a record note from mam and start taking photos. And suddenly navarasa🤣🤣🤣🤣 called naren. I mano and parasu laughed so large and asked to send the record which was photo copied by kiruba. From then mano started calling naren, naren🤐🤐🤐🤐. I said ok. Sachin from front called me and told to not send the file. I didn't tell anything. And then we headed to chemistry lab and the fun begins, I mano Arjun and porch shared the table. Mam asked us to do confamotory test for simple salt 1 and we done somthing and after completion while cleaning the test tube i broke one and without anyone notice other than mano Arjun and Gautam. I came. Then after lunch we had maths and we continued. Manoin between mimicing girl voice in worst sound calling me naren, naren. I can't tell him anything. I said shut the mouth.   After then we reached the hostel and I shared the pdf file from kiruba.literally i forgot about it. Then we gone for play football and had tea and sir was now gone on leave and will arrive on Friday evening. I stayed back in room with sherays while Motta and porch went for indoor. I got reply as thanks. Then I revised waves and now I was revising organic chemistry.       The Moments may have been ended but Memories last forever
                  
                                  You need to be yourself unless you cannot be an airline pilot.    Jai hind.      Pilots never walk they love flying.</p></div>



	<div><h4>27 May 2022</h4><p>Watched YouTube and listening songs.
Last two weeks there was both ups and downs in my life.I am just a man of fucking nonsense.I can't stop of thinking but now good compared to last month. May 20 my birthday first time celebrated in school in my life new feeling. Wore uniform as I don't want to be unique. I always like to be unique but not like this but to achieve.
Asked mano to buy chocolate. Mano brought diary milk 5rs box containing 90 pieces and another 20 KitKat. I thought this will be enough for class and both hostels. Sir was not present for 3 days as he went for leave. On 19th night Deena Shreyas and ezhil stayed awake and wished me at 12.
Mano parasu and pranav messaged me. Nitish and danesh bro also. But unexpected was vunayagam sir😂😂😂😂. I in sema sleep i Said thanks and slept. On Morning mithilesh bro wished me and I called my mother. And I went to school . Mano brought me what I want. All my classmates wished me. I wore new uniform which I brought the day before. We are in phase 2. As everyday mano and I just watching outside😁😁😁😁. After we entered the class i distributed chocolate to all.boys be boys all took chocolate first and then gave hands. But girls what they did mano I and other all had super fun. As the matter of gesture I just showed the chocolate box . But they asked for hand shake. Two girls gave hand shake but I still don't know whether I gave chocolate to 3rd one or not but they not give shake hand. I don't know why I and mano laught😝😝😝😝😝.. Navarasa asked that whether today is birthday 😑😑😑(am i looking like mad). But really I don't expect this, she asked why I not wore new dress. I replied with yes. And she wished me. And took chocolate.

    Next what full of fun. I don't know what happing there. Then mano told kiruba was taking video but the video was ended before. Just miss.


 Then we had maths class followed by CS.
Boys asked me why I not were colour dress. After lunch we went to phase 1 while I was watching tab. Wini papa came to class and wished me. Then we had physics class were i was sleeping with mano. I still don't know why he said I will do the problem in easy method and took 30 min for the problem 😴😴😴😴. At 3pm break i and mano gone out for restroom while crossing 12th FIITJEE class. Mano stoped me said said someone is calling. Then I saw Motta allu near staircase i thought who going to call me. And waited for seconds and then i realised it was me they called. Then along with her other two also joined. I took chocolate from class and gave to them. Now what the problem is chocolate is over only remaining. It's ok. Then after the class we went to hostel. And i chocolate to all in boys hostel. At i forgot to write this, i never expected this also that day mano gifted me a hugh 100rs chocolate and a note(which I asked). Then Motta came and asked whether his allu wished. I said yes. Then he said he gave Kit kat to her but she refused and gave to wini. And Avan anniku fulla idadan polambitu irrundan. Seri solli partum innum thirundala Motta.
But that they went well then sir came at 7.and we had dinner and slept that day.

It's ok to not be ok.......




Mano for next 3 days he was saying neelam yaaru ponnukalam Kai kodukura, periya allu nee. Probably this was my only first or second time to sake hand with a girl.(And these çredit also goes to AKT). I was happy as someone i never spoke wished me on their own. I felt slightly ashamed for not speaking to any girls even when they speak. Need to change my character mano said this to me.


Then on Monday after lunch at phase 1. While boys playing with ball tarun Gautam unexpectedly hit navarasa.
Next day same happen but this timeano throw it to kiruba but it bounced on kiruba hands and hit same one. This te she shouted with angry. And at last period (ptt) Sachin hit her with very small piece of chalk.
While moving to hostel. Near the manimandabam navarasa called me. I don't know why it was me. Since Shreyas and porch was also there. But since I was with the gang boys she could called me and asked.
  And asked who throws chalk on her.
I asked as I don't know 😂😂. (But feel sorry for that). I think we hit her and she got over frustrated and came fully shouted but at last she said na romba kovama pesiteno.🙄🙄🙄. And left with bye as usual. Cannot forget this day...........

<div><h4>24 June 2022</h4><p>      Still dreaming the same thing. I can't change my mind from that phenomenon. I can't even tell to anyone which can help me mentally. Daily night window outside view + earphone with sad music + no interference and 12:00 AM. A full bliss for me. Thinking of past memories. "Life's gives as tears smiles and memories. Tears dryed, smile faded but Memories last." Crying inside without let others knows. Still having the hunting of fake relation in this world. Talking something in front and telling back other. Barath was typing the script for assembly he was typing slowly so I typed it for him. All was gone fine but girls came he taking advantage of me not talking to them. I am a web developer I know that, but he saying i don't know anything. I didn't say anything i doesn't want to prove him who I am. Thinking of how a man chaging for making himself big in front called girls. Still thinking of same April 5, i can't stop remembering. What happened on that day can be small one for others for me it is still unforgettable. It appears while sleeping bathing in class and daily. It just kill my other dreams. Makes me sorrow i can't even tell to other about the feelings. Marappadhilai Nenje. Can't stop thinking of it. One think I done on 18 June that fear i has can't be expressed in words. All bois done team work for work and are all interconnected with other by zoom for sharing answers. You know i always check that everyone gets everything in friends. I don't leave anyone behind. This is what bakya Raj told to me when I took incharge of my troop.   So In exam i checked that all got the answer key since I took incharge of answer key. Everyone has the key. Except one so I asked that if need??. I didn't think of anything before sending but after sending i realised that na yenda innada yelaya parten. Ida porch dane pannuvan😂😂😂.  I was in fear. Then came the reply "mm send pannuriya"  then I forwarded all the key. Yeppa anda message ku reply varadu kulla sema bayam aayuruchu. Adalam ok namba pasanga answer key ye tapu tapa yedukuranga. Mano enna typing nu, sema fast  yrendu finger la type panna. Gautam and laith tum answer check pannanga . Na physics answer send pannen. Loki yellam answerium paper la yeludi ore message la poran. Mottatula anniki sema ya ellarum cooperate pannom. Idula na second bench la avar kannu munnadi answer key yeduten.

                  You need to be yourself unless you cannot be an airline pilot.  Jai hind.  A Good pilot is always learning 
</p></div>



<div><h4>18th June 2022,</h4><p>After long day, today I am writing,
      
        Got this thinking while writing today's exam(advance 2 phase 4), marks are asusal low 20 in 2nd paper and 63 in 1st paper and 96 in mains😕😕😕. Tried my best.  While writing paper 2 i don't know anything so I was thinking of something other. This is what got in mind. " Don't know why I am sad but also happy. Thinking of something that happened in past. For everyone this can be simple as like, But for me this is a miracle that will only happen once in my lifetime. Never thought of it or dreamed of it. But all it happens as my faith. Never forget this day and all day will not same as before. Life is too short to live a same day twice. Dream pilot!! A day cannot be repeated or the Moments cannot be repeated but Memories can be remained and repeated.". What ever happen happens. Never ever I tried to keep happiness myself as I did once hen I lost my whole happiness, time,friends. I wasted my time in search of happiness, then I realised that not only happiness but also sadness fear everything is like wind, while it blows it touches it showers everything. At that time we utilise and experience it. But when tries to hold it, it goes and we cry for it. It is a great life lesson for me. I waste my sleep time with useless dreams and thought. I know who am I and no one other there to tell me who am I and what I here for. Yes I feel the change. My character was fully changed. I need to be myself. Must control the use of fitarta lty words in public and with friends. Reduce the unwanted time and increase the study time. Wake up time need to be improved. Here after need to wake up at 5. Sister birthday is incoming 20 June. Missing my friends who are always with me. Kissore , ezhil. After they gone The hostel was like anything and not like before missing kissore and it's vibe. But it's ok to not be ok

Most things happened in this week. Starts from 12th boys last day. We became the official seniors upto today many things happened. Somethings are I never expected asusal but it comes under regular usual. Somethings i even I didn't told to mano. What I got mano's friendship is a bliss. We showed this week what is a team work. Someone says about me, i didn't going to get that and feeling about that. I will show who am I to them in their own way. I know I have problems and what I have in mind is only upto me.  I didn't want to share it to anyone other than this mail. But some are still there who thinks telling our problems is a way of earning respect. But still why not me??. This is where I don't think of them or talk to them. I avoid them in whatever way I see them. Today exam was a example we when our classical method doesn't work we recreated ourself  for new problems. Loki took incharge as the admin and he guided the boies and everyone helped to get the answer. New 11 boys are good. Sachin one of the finest with great literature. But what all 3 are commited. What a fast changing world!!  I always get mental stress don't know why. But one thing I will be serious keep on studying as I done in past don't think of others and memories. Think you future and your aims and dreams. Touch the sky with its glory

                        If something is great for someone it doesn't mean it must be great for me.

What does it mean when you can't stop thinking about someone?
           <br>    ------- the question I ask daily..<br>



The person made you feel valued.
<br>
You know how rare it is to see someone’s eyes sparkle when you talk?          -----Yess......
<br>
And the person isn’t just anyone.
<br>

Even if  not supermodel attractive by any objective standard, but probably beautiful.
<br>
…
Poof..... They vanished.
<br>
Maybe  didn’t vanish completely but certainly aren’t as available as you want to be.
<br>
In the absence, i am  left wondering.
<br>
What is happening?
<br>
thinking about me?
<br>
Wouldn’t my time be better if near?
<br>
The more i  think, the more these thoughts spiral out of control. These thoughts feed off each other.
And so i turn to the internet and ask:

Why can't I stop thinking about this person?
<br>
""But if you even have to ask the question…

You already know the answer.""
<br>
Why am I depressed. Not sleeping properly at night unneeded dreams and thinking daily. Depressed when seeing and alone. But all this ok but why am I depressed thinking of same
I consult solution . It says
<br>"Some people simply believe that our thoughts can be completely random and thus doesn't have any specific meanings.Thinking so, they ignore these thoughts just to end up thinking more and more about the same" i think the same as happened to me as I just started to ignore the thoughts. It's started to repeat in my mind daily
<br>"So, if you understand the real reason why you are unable to stop thinking about someone, you can come out of depression" the real reason of my problem is likely guilt.  Until 5th April my utmost dream is pilot and defence and followed by coding and others like Playing but at night of April 5 a small 2 min made by brain something crazy. But my heart is only filled with aviation and defence(i am happy ) Jai hind....    But still I am mentally disturbed since I never got this much upto now. Since in my old school(AKT) we never think of this or even talking and i came here with same mindset. I don't like here talking to any girls or seeing them. Here is what I made mistakes and now feeling of guiltiness.and that night made me realise that world is a total lie. I can't forget that day
    


<br>
This is what really happened on that night

	<div><h4>2nd August 2022</h4><p> A day of great things happened. Just got released from someone. Feeling free and like forgetting someone who gave much to remember. Can say , simling with pain. It's god's plane. Now it's time to study. Forget everything. Dream pilot...........


Something is distrubing,,, why it just me!!????? Why me only???? Lot's there to answer. Never let something to change your dream...  Jai hind </p>

Just after many days  again writing these, today a wonderful day starting by new room . Gone to school hanifa sir gave chemistry paper 36 at first then to 42. I just shocked as in didn't believe. It is that subject which I wrote well. Then next Cs asusal 58 then 60. But the mark is somewhat low then expected. Next when leving school I amazed to see 3 su30mki 2 in formation and one back of other two. Low flying just amazing . I think there are operating from tanjure airbase. These are bhramos armed aircraft. Just got feeling of that pilot. One day I will be flying like this. .. 
   
   Dream pilot !!   Jai hind!!! </p>
