Never ever thought that this will happen in my life<br>

A girl says let go together in walk at night<br>

Talked about exam and she said why did you go faster before day<br>

Her friend said go and run fast.. i thought she kalaching me but soon realised that she comes with me..<br>

Never forget this day in my life.<br>
Mano said you are so lucky<br>
But still don't know anything.. I told him everything the next day..<br>
And consecutive days we talked at night while going to hostel<br><br><br>

Anything a unforgettable day..<br>


Till yesterday (12.04.2022 Tuesday) talked with her.. but not in class as usual i don't know whyyyy

In the sate of Confucius my mind and can't concentrate..<br><br>


On Monday (11-04-2022) she didn't speak. Don't know why. Can be due to my friend mano catching me to go with her  or so anything<br><br>


I didn't sleep that day.. I called mano at 10 and scorlded him for catching me. <br>
He says most 75% probably that I need to talk with her personally..
<br>
I started to fear slighty. Not saw her face . But all not gone to problem as she talk with me yesterday..<br>

But not talked with her today..<br>
Hoping so .......<br><br>

Today 28 may 2022 Saturday 2:30AM<br>
       Night no sleep. Don't know why??<br>
<br>
Watched YouTube and listening songs.
Last two weeks there was both ups and downs in my life.I am just a man of fucking nonsense.I can't stop of thinking but now good compared to last month. May 20 my birthday first time celebrated in school in my life new feeling. Wore uniform as I don't want to be unique. I always like to be unique but not like this but to achieve.<br><br>
Asked mano to buy chocolate. Mano brought diary milk 5rs box containing 90 pieces and another 20 KitKat. I thought this will be enough for class and both hostels. Sir was not present for 3 days as he went for leave. On 19th night Deena Shreyas and ezhil stayed awake and wished me at 12.
Mano parasu and pranav messaged me. Nitish and danesh bro also. But unexpected was vunayagam sir😂😂😂😂. I in sema sleep i Said thanks and slept. On Morning mithilesh bro wished me and I called my mother. And I went to school . Mano brought me what I want. All my classmates wished me. I wore new uniform which I brought the day before. We are in phase 2. As everyday mano and I just watching outside😁😁😁😁. After we entered the class i distributed chocolate to all.boys be boys all took chocolate first and then gave hands. But girls what they did mano I and other all had super fun. As the matter of gesture I just showed the chocolate box . But they asked for hand shake. Two girls gave hand shake but I still don't know whether I gave chocolate to 3rd one or not but they not give shake hand. I don't know why I and mano laught😝😝😝😝😝.. Navarasa asked that whether today is birthday 😑😑😑(am i looking like mad). But really I don't expect this, she asked why I not wore new dress. I replied with yes. And she wished me. And took chocolate.<br><br>

    Next what full of fun. I don't know what happing there. Then mano told kiruba was taking video but the video was ended before. Just miss.<br><br>

<br><br>
 Then we had maths class followed by CS.
Boys asked me why I not were colour dress. After lunch we went to phase 1 while I was watching tab. Wini papa came to class and wished me. Then we had physics class were i was sleeping with mano. I still don't know why he said I will do the problem in easy method and took 30 min for the problem 😴😴😴😴. At 3pm break i and mano gone out for restroom while crossing 12th FIITJEE class. Mano stoped me said said someone is calling. Then I saw Motta allu near staircase i thought who going to call me. And waited for seconds and then i realised it was me they called. Then along with her other two also joined. I took chocolate from class and gave to them. Now what the problem is chocolate is over only remaining. It's ok. Then after the class we went to hostel. And i chocolate to all in boys hostel. At i forgot to write this, i never expected this also that day mano gifted me a hugh 100rs chocolate and a note(which I asked). Then Motta came and asked whether his allu wished. I said yes. Then he said he gave Kit kat to her but she refused and gave to wini. And Avan anniku fulla idadan polambitu irrundan. Seri solli partum innum thirundala Motta.<br><br>
But that they went well then sir came at 7.and we had dinner and slept that day.<br><br>

It's ok to not be ok.......


<br><br>

Mano for next 3 days he was saying neelam yaaru ponnukalam Kai kodukura, periya allu nee. Probably this was my only first or second time to sake hand with a girl.(And these çredit also goes to AKT). I was happy as someone i never spoke wished me on their own. I felt slightly ashamed for not speaking to any girls even when they speak. Need to change my character mano said this to me.
<br><br>

Then on Monday after lunch at phase 1. While boys playing with ball tarun Gautam unexpectedly hit navarasa.
Next day same happen but this timeano throw it to kiruba but it bounced on kiruba hands and hit same one. This te she shouted with angry. And at last period (ptt) Sachin hit her with very small piece of chalk.<br><br>
While moving to hostel. Near the manimandabam navarasa called me. I don't know why it was me. Since Shreyas and porch was also there. But since I was with the gang boys she could called me and asked.
  And asked who throws chalk on her.<br><br>
I asked as I don't know 😂😂. (But feel sorry for that). I think we hit her and she got over frustrated and came fully shouted but at last she said na romba kovama pesiteno.🙄🙄🙄. And left with bye as usual. Cannot forget this day...........<br><br>

	16th May 2022 After long days of summer holidays. Today 12 classes started. Met the school vibe. Crowd bathroom and alleyways.. and myself getting cured from my own problems and now I am most ready and I got my old concentration in class and study time. But now not crying but feeling sad for being sad these many days and wasted my time even my holidays and free time,, family time. 
Motta came yesterday at 4pm. As I thought he stated to make fun of me. All due to one man MANO. But he shared memes on Motta and Deena which was full of worth. And Motta told that all hostel boys should not talk to girls. As he was hurt. I feel sorry for Motta whatever I made fun of him . I know how much difficult is that the phase he crossed and what he experienced. I asked sorry to him. 
    At night 9:30pm we was listening song on speaker outside with all my friends including bro's and chit chated for 20min.. almost after muchdays we spoke . Motta atlast spoke to allu. It's all good. Just for another 1 month they stay here. Feeling sad hearing this but can't avoid it as it is truth.😔😔😔. Today asusal School class we mano parasu kiruba all was chating. And we had today assembly. It last long but not like pervious one. 1 period English gone asusal as we don't listen English. I mano and kiruba was making comments on lesson. 2nd chemistry we had our pratical season today. Mam asked us to write record note. But we lazzy fellows insted we took photo. I and kiruba got a record note from mam and start taking photos. And suddenly navarasa🤣🤣🤣🤣 called naren. I mano and parasu laughed so large and asked to send the record which was photo copied by kiruba. From then mano started calling naren, naren🤐🤐🤐🤐. I said ok. Sachin from front called me and told to not send the file. I didn't tell anything. And then we headed to chemistry lab and the fun begins, I mano Arjun and porch shared the table. Mam asked us to do confamotory test for simple salt 1 and we done somthing and after completion while cleaning the test tube i broke one and without anyone notice other than mano Arjun and Gautam. I came. Then after lunch we had maths and we continued. Manoin between mimicing girl voice in worst sound calling me naren, naren. I can't tell him anything. I said shut the mouth.   After then we reached the hostel and I shared the pdf file from kiruba.literally i forgot about it. Then we gone for play football and had tea and sir was now gone on leave and will arrive on Friday evening. I stayed back in room with sherays while Motta and porch went for indoor. I got reply as thanks. Then I revised waves and now I was revising organic chemistry.       The Moments may have been ended but Memories last forever
